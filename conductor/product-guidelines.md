# Product Guidelines

## Prose & Communication Style
- **Tone:** Professional, precise, and authoritative. Use industry-standard manufacturing and accounting terminology.
- **Clarity:** Notifications and error messages must be actionable and specific (e.g., "Inventory insufficient: Order 500 units" instead of "Error").
- **Language:** Japanese (Primary) with English technical terms where appropriate.

## User Interface (UI) Principles
- **Efficiency:** Prioritize data density and quick readability for tables and dashboards.
- **Responsiveness:** Optimize for desktop (management/planning) and tablet (factory floor) viewports.
- **Consistency:** Adhere strictly to the defined color palette for status indicators (e.g., Green=Normal, Red=Alert/Stop, Yellow=Warning).
- **Accessibility:** Ensure high contrast for critical alerts and clear visual distinctions for color-blind users.

## Data Visualization Guidelines
- **Charts:** Use specific chart types for specific data (Gantt for schedules, Waterfall for cost variance, Control Charts for quality).
- **Real-time Indicators:** Use distinct visual cues (pulsing, bolding) for real-time data updates.

## Interaction Patterns
- **Drag & Drop:** Use for scheduling adjustments.
- **Modal Workflows:** Use for critical approvals and confirmations to prevent accidental actions.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts:** Support for power users in data entry screens.
