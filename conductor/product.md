# Initial Concept
生産計画最適化・原価管理システム（ProCost Manager）: An integrated manufacturing management system designed to optimize production planning and provide real-time cost control.

# Product Guide (ProCost Manager)

## Project Vision
To transform manufacturing operations by eliminating manual planning inefficiencies and data silos. The goal is to maximize equipment utilization (target +20% improvement) and enable daily profitability tracking through real-time cost calculation and digital approval workflows.

## Core Features
- **Production Planning Optimization:** Automated plan generation based on demand and equipment capacity, featuring Gantt chart visualizations and manual drag-and-drop adjustments.
- **Material Requirements Planning (MRP):** Multi-level BOM expansion and inventory-aware net requirement calculations with automated procurement suggestions.
- **Digital Approval Workflows:** Multi-stage approval processes for production plans and critical cost variances (±10% or >1M JPY).
- **Manufacturing Execution (MES):** QR code-based material checkout, tablet-based progress reporting at each process step, and real-time equipment monitoring.
- **Real-time Cost Management:** Automated calculation of material, labor, and overhead costs with detailed variance analysis (Price/Quantity for materials, Rate/Efficiency for labor).
- **Quality & Traceability:** Integrated inspection recording, defect analysis (5-Why, Fishbone), and full lot-level traceability from materials to finished goods.
- **Data Portability:** Extensive Excel integration for importing plans/BOM and exporting comprehensive analysis reports and production orders.

## Target Audience
- **Production Managers:** For planning, adjustment, and approval.
- **Manufacturing Leaders:** For execution, progress reporting, and quality control.
- **Cost Accountants:** For variance analysis and financial reporting.
- **Procurement Officers:** For material ordering and supplier management.
- **Executives:** For KPI monitoring and high-level decision-making.
